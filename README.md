#Summary of Project#

This project entailed designing an automated measuring/testing and analysis system aimed at detecting and measuring the impact of a single-pulse response electrical charge on any electronic components, silicon substrate and other materials. In simple terms, the system detects and measures the ability of component/substrate to change its state when subjected to charge, as the change of state property is significant in many areas, especially in the innovative area of Neuromorphic computing. 
The system integrates a signal generator (Agilent 33220a) for pulse generation and a digital oscilloscope (HP 54504A) for component response measurement. Additionally, a software programme, written in the SCPI programming language within a Keysight VEE Pro 9.3 development environment, which is similar to LabVIEW, automates the entire measuring, capturing, and analysis process. This design which was initially tailored for research in neuromorphic computing technology, holds potential applications across numerous research fields, including carrier life, memristive and spintronic technology, and phase change random access memory.
